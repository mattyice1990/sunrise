                <p>Knowing when it’s time for a <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong> isn&#39;t always straightforward, but the signs are usually there if you know what to look for. When you see widespread cracking, curling shingles across the roof field, or gutters full of granules, you&#39;re past the point of simple repairs. The intense Arizona sun cooks the life out of roofing materials, and putting off a replacement often means trading a manageable project for a catastrophic failure down the road.</p>
<h2>Knowing When to Replace Your Tucson Roof</h2>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/7f001e09-cca9-4a5b-a631-db56e859b4dd/d705d7bf-089c-444c-8527-da1073be6919.jpg" alt="A roofer inspecting a sun-drenched residential roof in Tucson, highlighting potential damage areas." /></figure></p>
<p>Your roof is the only thing standing between your home and Tucson’s one-two punch of brutal summer heat and violent monsoon storms. While a quick patch can fix an isolated problem, there’s a tipping point where a full replacement becomes the smarter, safer, and ultimately more affordable choice. Ignoring the warning signs won’t make them disappear—it just raises the stakes for the next big downpour.</p>
<p>Deciding to invest in a new roof is a big step, but understanding the key failure points helps you make the call at the right time. Catching systemic wear early prevents the kind of water damage, mold, and structural issues that turn a roofing project into a full-blown renovation.</p>
<h3>Visual Clues You Can Spot from the Ground</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t need to get on a ladder to do an initial health check. A simple walk around your property can reveal some serious red flags that tell you it&#39;s time to call in a professional.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for these tell-tale signs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curling or Clawing Shingles:</strong> When shingle edges start to curl up or the corners lift, they’ve reached the end of their service life. Tucson&#39;s relentless UV exposure bakes the asphalt, causing shingles to shrink, become brittle, and lose their ability to shed water.</li>
<li><strong>Widespread Cracking:</strong> A few cracked shingles might be a simple fix. But if you see cracks running across multiple sections of your roof, that’s a clear sign of system-wide material failure. Every crack is an open door for water during our monsoon season.</li>
<li><strong>Bald Spots and Granule Loss:</strong> Check your gutters and the ground near your downspouts for what looks like coarse black sand. Those are the protective granules from your shingles. Once they’re gone, the underlying asphalt is exposed directly to the sun, and deterioration accelerates fast.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Signs of an Aging Roof System</h3>
<p>Even a roof that looks decent from a distance has a shelf life. Most standard asphalt shingle roofs in our climate are built to last around <strong>20 to 25 years</strong>. If your roof is hitting that age, it’s living on borrowed time, no matter how good it looks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proactive replacement of an old roof is an investment in peace of mind. It lets you avoid the chaos and inflated costs of an emergency repair after a storm has already done its damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get a better sense of what to look for, use this quick checklist. These are the most common indicators we see in the field that point toward a necessary roof replacement.</p>
<h3>Tucson Roof Replacement Warning Signs Checklist</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Warning Sign</th>
<th align="left">What It Looks Like</th>
<th align="left">Why It Matters in Tucson</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Curling Shingle Edges</strong></td>
<td align="left">The bottom edges of shingles are turning upward, creating a cupped appearance.</td>
<td align="left">Extreme UV exposure has baked the shingle, causing it to shrink and lose flexibility. It can no longer seal properly against wind-driven rain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Widespread Cracking</strong></td>
<td align="left">Visible cracks and fissures across many shingles, not just one or two.</td>
<td align="left">A sign of advanced material aging. These cracks are direct pathways for water, especially during heavy monsoon downpours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Excessive Granule Loss</strong></td>
<td align="left">&quot;Bald&quot; patches on shingles and heavy accumulation of granules in gutters.</td>
<td align="left">The granules are the shingle&#39;s UV protection. Without them, the asphalt layer deteriorates rapidly under the intense Arizona sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Age Over 20 Years</strong></td>
<td align="left">The roof is approaching or has passed the two-decade mark.</td>
<td align="left">Even without obvious damage, the underlayment and sealants have likely degraded, making the entire system vulnerable to failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Persistent Leaks</strong></td>
<td align="left">Water stains on ceilings or walls that reappear despite previous repairs.</td>
<td align="left">This often indicates a systemic failure in the flashing or underlayment that spot repairs can no longer fix.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Catching these signs early can save you from the high cost and stress of interior water damage. The cost of waiting too long is always higher than the cost of a timely replacement.</p>
<p>While a ground-level check is a great first step, some of the most critical problems are hidden. Damaged decking, failed underlayment, or improper flashing around vents and chimneys are things only a trained professional can spot. For a definitive answer on your roof&#39;s condition, a detailed <a href="https://roofwithsunrise.com/roofing-services/roof-inspection">roof inspection</a> is the only way to get the full picture.</p>
<h2>Choosing Materials That Beat the Arizona Heat</h2>
<p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/7f001e09-cca9-4a5b-a631-db56e859b4dd/16e4aa5f-3679-4b08-9e79-d45283f6e599.jpg" alt="Three different types of roofing materials suitable for hot climates, laid out side-by-side." /></figure></p>
<p>Picking the right material for your <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong> is about way more than just curb appeal. It’s a strategic choice that directly impacts your home&#39;s durability, your summer cooling bills, and its ability to handle decades of brutal sun and monsoon downpours.</p>
<p>Think of it as your home&#39;s primary shield. In Southern Arizona, that shield needs to be exceptionally tough. The wrong material will get cooked by the UV rays, leading to early failure and costly repairs. The right one is a long-term investment, keeping your home cooler and secure, saving you money and headaches down the road.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Shingles: An Evolving Classic</h3>
<p>Asphalt shingles are popular for a reason—they&#39;re affordable and come in tons of styles. But not all shingles are built for our climate. Standard 3-tab shingles just can&#39;t handle the intense UV radiation here; they tend to get brittle and crack long before their time.</p>
<p>For any home in Tucson, <strong>architectural or dimensional shingles</strong> are the only way to go. They’re thicker, heavier, and built with multiple layers that give them far better resistance to wind, hail, and sun damage.</p>
<p>Many modern architectural shingles now include &quot;cool roof&quot; technology. They&#39;re made with reflective granules that literally bounce solar heat away from your roof. This isn&#39;t just a marketing gimmick—it can seriously lower the temperature in your attic, meaning your AC unit doesn&#39;t have to work nearly as hard. The upfront cost is a bit more, but the longer lifespan and energy savings make it a smart play.</p>
<h3>Clay and Concrete Tile: Timeless Desert Defenders</h3>
<p>Drive through any established Tucson neighborhood, and you&#39;ll see tile roofs everywhere. They are a classic for a reason. Both clay and concrete tiles are incredibly durable and perfectly suited for the desert.</p>
<p>Their biggest advantage is how they handle heat. The curved shape creates a natural air gap between the tile and the roof deck. This air pocket acts as a thermal barrier, dramatically cutting down on the heat that gets into your home.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tile roof is like wearing a wide-brimmed hat on a sunny day. It doesn&#39;t just block the sun; it creates a pocket of shade that keeps the surface underneath significantly cooler. This natural insulation is a key reason tile is a classic choice for Southwestern architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While they&#39;re tough against the sun, tiles can be brittle. A large hailstone or someone walking on them improperly can cause cracks, which makes professional installation and periodic checks critical. Cost is also a major factor. The statewide average for a Clay Terra Cotta tile roof—a popular choice here—is around <strong>$53,748</strong>. Material choices drive these costs, and you can see a full breakdown of <a href="https://www.instantroofer.com/arizona-roof-replacement-cost/">state-wide roofing material costs on instantroofer.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Metal Roofing: Modern Durability and Efficiency</h3>
<p>Metal roofing used to be just for commercial buildings, but it&#39;s now a top-tier choice for homeowners who want extreme longevity and energy efficiency. Standing seam metal roofs, in particular, are an outstanding option for Tucson.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptional Durability:</strong> A metal roof can easily last <strong>50 years or more</strong>. It won’t crack, peel, or warp under the intense sun, and it handles monsoon winds and rain with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Heat Reflectivity:</strong> Most metal roofing comes with factory-applied coatings designed to reflect a huge percentage of solar radiation. This &quot;cool roof&quot; performance is some of the best you can get, leading to real, measurable savings on cooling bills.</li>
<li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Once it&#39;s installed correctly, a metal roof is pretty much maintenance-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>The look of metal has come a long way, too. You can get it in a wide range of colors to fit any style, from modern to traditional. The main hurdle is the upfront cost, as it’s typically higher than both shingles and tile. But if you plan on being in your home for the long haul, the combination of insane durability and energy savings makes it a powerful investment.

<h3>Comparing Top Roofing Materials for Tucson Homes</h3>
<p>Choosing between these excellent options can feel overwhelming. Each material has its own set of trade-offs when it comes to lifespan, heat resistance, and cost in our specific climate.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the best choice depends on your budget, how long you plan to stay in your home, and the style you&#39;re going for. All three are solid performers in the desert when installed correctly.</p>
<h2>Decoding Your Roof Replacement Estimate</h2>
<iframe width="100%" style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ccWMQpIzp_w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Getting a multi-page estimate for a <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong> can feel overwhelming. It’s packed with line items for materials, labor, permits, and more—making it easy to get lost in the jargon.</p>
<p>But that document is your project roadmap. Learning to read it is the single best way to make sure you’re getting a fair price and, more importantly, a quality job. A professional quote does more than just list a final number; it breaks down the entire scope of work, from the specific underlayment being used to the cost of hauling away the old shingles.</p>
<p>If a quote feels vague or confusing, that’s a major red flag.</p>
<h3>Key Components of a Tucson Roofing Quote</h3>
<p>While every roofer formats their quotes a little differently, any solid proposal will include a few non-negotiable sections. You need a detailed breakdown that separates the major costs so you can see exactly where your money is going.</p>
<p>Look for these core elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Materials Cost:</strong> This is usually the biggest chunk of the estimate. It should specify the brand and type of shingles or tiles, underlayment, flashing, vents, and drip edge. A good roofer lists these out.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Costs:</strong> This covers the crew’s time and expertise for both the tear-off of the old roof and the installation of the new one. The price reflects the complexity of your roof’s slopes and features.</li>
<li><strong>Tear-Off and Disposal Fees:</strong> Removing and legally disposing of tons of old roofing material costs money. This line item covers the dump fees and the labor to keep your property clean.</li>
<li><strong>Permit Fees:</strong> Any full roof replacement in Tucson requires a permit from the city or Pima County. Your contractor should handle pulling it, and the fee will be passed through to you on the estimate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding Labor and Material Costs</h3>
<p>Both labor and material costs shift with the market, but you can find some reliable local benchmarks. For example, recent Tucson data shows asphalt shingle installation averaging around <strong>$202.65 per 100 square feet</strong>, particularly for overlay jobs. Having numbers like these helps you gauge whether a quote is in the right ballpark. You can <a href="https://www.instantroofer.com/arizona-roof-replacement-cost/tucson/">explore local roofing installation data on instantroofer.com</a> to see more current pricing trends.</p>
<p>This is exactly why getting multiple quotes is so critical. One contractor might get better pricing on GAF shingles, while another has a more efficient crew, lowering their labor costs. Comparing line-item estimates is the only way to spot these differences.</p>
<h3>The Hidden Costs You Need to Anticipate</h3>
<p>The most common surprise on any re-roofing project is finding rotten decking <em>after</em> the old roof comes off. The plywood or OSB sheathing under your shingles can be slowly damaged by tiny, undetected leaks over many years. There’s simply no way for a contractor to see it until the tear-off begins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A professional roofer will include a clause in their estimate that specifies the per-sheet cost for replacing any damaged decking. This isn&#39;t an upsell; it&#39;s a crucial contingency that ensures your new roof is installed on a solid, structurally sound foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without that pre-agreed price, you’re stuck negotiating costs for extra work right in the middle of the project. A transparent quote prepares you for this possibility from the start.</p>
<p>Another potential cost is bringing your attic ventilation up to code. Tucson’s building codes for <strong>residential roofing</strong> mandate proper ventilation to manage the extreme attic heat. If your current system is inadequate, your contractor will need to add more vents. It’s a necessary step to ensure your new roof lasts and your home stays energy-efficient. You can read more about why a complete system is so important for <a href="https://www.roofwithsunrise.com/residential-roofing-tucson">residential roofing in Tucson on our service page</a>.</p>
<p>By understanding each part of your estimate, you turn a confusing document into a powerful tool. It lets you ask smart questions, compare offers apples-to-apples, and invest confidently in protecting your home from the tough Tucson climate. A detailed estimate is the hallmark of a contractor who values transparency and professionalism.</p>
<h2>Finding a Tucson Roofer You Can Trust</h2>
<p>Even the best roofing materials on the market will fail in just a few years if they aren&#39;t installed correctly. That’s why your choice of contractor is just as critical as your choice of shingle or tile for your <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong>. A great roofer makes sure every single component—from the underlayment to the final flashing—is installed to handle decades of intense desert sun and monsoon storms.</p>
<p>Hiring the right team isn&#39;t just about getting a good price. It&#39;s an investment in craftsmanship that truly protects your home. A professional brings licensed expertise and accountability, giving you peace of mind that the job will be done right the first time.</p>
<h3>Where to Start Your Search</h3>
<p>Start local. Look for well-established companies with a real presence in the Tucson community. A roofer who’s been working here for years gets it—they know the specific challenges our climate throws at a roof. They know which materials hold up best under extreme UV exposure and exactly how to seal a roof against those torrential monsoon downpours.</p>
<p>Check online reviews on platforms like Google and the Better Business Bureau (BBB), but don&#39;t just glance at the star rating. Dive into the actual comments. See how companies handle communication, job site cleanup, and any hiccups that pop up. Consistent, detailed praise about professionalism is a fantastic sign.</p>
<h3>Vetting Your Shortlist of Contractors</h3>
<p>Once you have a few names, it’s time to dig into their credentials. This is a non-negotiable step that separates the true professionals from everyone else. The first and most important stop is the Arizona Registrar of Contractors (ROC).</p>
<p>Use the ROC’s public database to confirm any contractor you’re considering has:</p>
<ul>
<li>An active license in good standing for roofing (<strong>Specialty Residential Contracting, R-42</strong>).</li>
<li>The required bond and workers&#39; compensation insurance.</li>
<li>A clean history, free of unresolved complaints or disciplinary actions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Never, ever hire a contractor who isn&#39;t licensed with the ROC. The ROC license is your primary protection. It proves the roofer has met state standards for experience and financial stability, and it gives you a formal process for recourse if the work goes south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the ROC, ask each contractor for a certificate of general liability insurance. This is what protects your property from accidental damage during the project. Any legitimate roofer will have this documentation ready and won&#39;t hesitate to provide it. For more on what sets a professional team apart, you can see the key reasons to <a href="https://roofwithsunrise.com/why-choose-sunrise-roofers-in-tucson">choose trusted roofers in Tucson</a> who make these credentials a priority.</p>
<h3>Critical Questions to Ask During the Consultation</h3>
<p>When a potential roofer comes to your home for an estimate, it’s your chance to interview them. Their answers will tell you a ton about their process, experience, and commitment to quality. Don’t just focus on the final price; this is your moment to gauge their professionalism.</p>
<p>Show up prepared with a few pointed questions that go beyond the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who will be my main point of contact?</strong> You want a dedicated project manager. It’s the key to clear communication from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>How will you protect my landscaping and property?</strong> A pro crew has a system. They use tarps and have specific methods for debris disposal to keep your property clean and undamaged.</li>
<li><strong>What’s your process for rotted decking or other surprises?</strong> They should have a clear, pre-defined plan and pricing for potential issues, and it should be spelled out in the estimate.</li>
<li><strong>Can you explain both your material and workmanship warranties?</strong> A quality roofer provides a solid workmanship warranty (covering their installation) that stands beside the manufacturer&#39;s material warranty. Get both in writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pay close attention to <em>how</em> they answer. Vague responses, high-pressure sales tactics, or an unwillingness to provide documents are huge red flags. A trustworthy roofer will be patient, transparent, and happy to give you all the info you need to make a confident decision for your home.</p>
<h2>What to Expect During Your Roof Installation</h2>
<p>A <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong> can feel like a big undertaking, but knowing what’s coming makes the whole process feel much smoother. Once you’ve signed the contract, a professional crew moves with purpose and follows a clear sequence of events.</p>
<p>Understanding this flow helps you prepare your home and feel confident from the moment the materials arrive to the final nail being swept up. The goal is to get the old, failing roof off and a new, watertight system on as safely and cleanly as possible, usually in just a few days.</p>
<h3>Preparing Your Home and Property</h3>
<p>The day before the real work starts, the crew will show up to prep your property. This is a tell-tale sign of a professional who respects your home. Don’t be surprised to see them taking a few key protective measures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Covering Landscaping:</strong> Your shrubs, plants, and flower beds near the house will get covered with tarps to shield them from falling debris.</li>
<li><strong>Protecting Siding and Windows:</strong> Plywood might be leaned against siding and windows in vulnerable spots to prevent any damage from old shingles being tossed down.</li>
<li><strong>Clearing the Perimeter:</strong> They&#39;ll move patio furniture, grills, and potted plants away from the walls to create a safe, clear work zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t just about being neat; it&#39;s about creating an organized and safe environment for everyone. A clean job site is a safe job site.</p>
<h3>The Tear-Off and Decking Inspection</h3>
<p>The first major step is the <strong>tear-off</strong>, and it’s usually the loudest part of the whole job. The crew will systematically strip away every layer of old material—shingles, underlayment, and flashing—all the way down to the bare wood decking.</p>
<p>This is the moment of truth. With the decking exposed, the project manager can finally perform a crucial inspection, getting the first real look at the structural foundation of your roof. They&#39;re looking for any signs of water damage, like soft spots, dark stains, or outright rot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any compromised decking <strong>must</strong> be replaced before the new roof goes on. You can&#39;t build a strong house on a weak foundation, and the same goes for a roof. Putting new materials over rotten wood is a recipe for failure and will void most warranties. A good contractor will have already discussed this possibility with you and included a per-sheet replacement cost in your estimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This step is non-negotiable. It ensures your new roof is built on a solid base, ready to handle Tucson’s climate for decades to come.</p>
<p>This infographic gives you a quick visual on the key steps for picking a contractor who will get these critical details right.<br><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.outrank.so/7f001e09-cca9-4a5b-a631-db56e859b4dd/05c7a28d-170a-4ab0-aa7a-40bfef16ee67.jpg" alt="Infographic about tucson roof replacement" /></figure><br>It really highlights how a thorough process—from checking licenses to comparing quotes—is what leads you to a crew that follows the proper installation procedures.</p>
<h3>Installing the New Roofing System</h3>
<p>With a solid deck confirmed, the build-back begins. This is where the real craftsmanship shows. The crew installs a completely new, multi-layered system where every component is designed to work together.</p>
<p>The installation follows a specific sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drip Edge and Underlayment:</strong> First, a metal drip edge goes on along the eaves to kick water into the gutters. Then, a fresh layer of high-performance synthetic underlayment is rolled out over the entire roof deck. This is your critical secondary water barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Installing New Materials:</strong> Whether you chose architectural shingles, classic tile, or sleek metal, the crew will start laying it down according to the manufacturer’s exact specifications. This means precise nailing patterns and perfect alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Flashing and Ventilation:</strong> New flashing is meticulously installed around chimneys, vents, and skylights—these are the most common spots for leaks. They’ll also install proper attic ventilation to help your home breathe and manage that intense Tucson heat.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see some incredible examples of these finished systems in our <a href="https://roofwithsunrise.com/gallery">Tucson roofing project gallery</a>.</p>
<h3>Final Cleanup and Inspection</h3>
<p>Once the last shingle is nailed down, the job shifts to cleanup mode, which is just as important as the installation itself. The crew will comb your yard with powerful magnetic rollers to find any stray nails, haul away all the debris, and put your property back exactly how they found it.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, the project manager will do a final walk-through with you. They’ll answer any questions you have and make sure you are <strong>100% satisfied</strong> with the work. The entire experience should feel professional and transparent, leaving you with a high-quality roof that will protect your home for years.</p>
<h2>Common Questions We Hear About Tucson Roof Replacements</h2>
<p>Even with a great contractor, a <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong> is a big project, and questions are going to come up. We get it. We’ve answered hundreds of them over the years, so we’ve put together the straight-up answers to the questions we hear most from homeowners just like you.</p>
<p>Knowing the specifics for Southern Arizona—from our building codes to our wild climate—can save you a ton of time and prevent future headaches.</p>
<h3>How Long Will My House Be a Construction Zone?</h3>
<p>This is usually the first thing people ask, and for good reason. The good news is, a professional crew works fast.</p>
<p>For a typical single-family home in Tucson, a standard asphalt shingle roof replacement usually takes <strong>1 to 3 days</strong>. That covers the full tear-off of the old roof, any minor repairs to the decking underneath, and the complete installation of the new system. If you have a larger, more complex roof with steep pitches or a bunch of skylights, it might push toward the longer end of that estimate.</p>
<p>Tile roofs are a different animal. The material is heavy, and the installation is much more labor-intensive. A tile roof replacement often takes <strong>4 to 7 days</strong>, sometimes longer, depending on the size of the job. And of course, an unexpected monsoon storm can always throw a wrench in the schedule, but any good roofer will keep you in the loop.</p>
<h3>Do I Really Need a Building Permit in Tucson?</h3>
<p>The answer here is short and simple: <strong>yes, absolutely</strong>. Any complete roof replacement in Tucson or anywhere else in Pima County requires a building permit. This isn&#39;t just about paperwork; it’s one of the most important safeguards you have as a homeowner.</p>
<p>The permit process ensures the job is documented and held to local building codes, which are specifically written to handle our intense desert heat and monsoon downpours. It&#39;s your guarantee that the work meets strict safety and quality standards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick word of advice: your contractor is the one responsible for pulling the permit. If any roofer suggests skipping it to &quot;save a little money,&quot; that&#39;s a massive red flag. An unpermitted job can create huge problems with your homeowner&#39;s insurance and when it’s time to sell your house.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Will a New Roof Actually Lower My Summer Cooling Bills?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to underestimate how much a new roof can impact your summer TEP bill, but the difference can be huge. A modern, energy-efficient roof system directly improves your home&#39;s thermal performance, which means lower cooling costs.</p>
<p>Many of today&#39;s best roofing materials, particularly architectural shingles and metal roofing, are designed with &quot;cool roof&quot; technology. They have special granules or coatings that reflect a huge percentage of the sun&#39;s infrared radiation away from your house.</p>
<p>This means far less heat gets absorbed into your attic. When your attic stays cooler, your AC unit doesn&#39;t have to work nearly as hard to keep your home comfortable. Over the <strong>20 to 30-year lifespan</strong> of your new roof, those energy savings really add up.</p>
<h3>What Kind of Warranty Should I Expect to Get?</h3>
<p>Understanding your warranty is critical. For any <strong>Tucson roof replacement</strong>, you should always get two separate warranties, both in writing. This is how you get complete protection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturer&#39;s Warranty:</strong> This comes straight from the company that made your shingles or tiles. It covers defects in the materials themselves and can last anywhere from <strong>20 years to a &quot;lifetime,&quot;</strong> depending on the product you choose.</li>
<li><strong>Contractor&#39;s Workmanship Warranty:</strong> This one is just as important. Your roofing company provides this to cover the quality of their installation. If a leak pops up because of an installation mistake, this is the warranty that has your back. A reputable Tucson roofer will always offer a workmanship warranty, typically for <strong>5 to 10 years</strong>.</li>
</ul>
